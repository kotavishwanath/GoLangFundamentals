GREAT BOOKS:

This book is also very approachable and great for beginners. 
Buy On Amazon ( http://amzn.to/1OnFtPY )


Great online resource offered by Caleb Doxsey for free - very similar to his book above. 
Read it online for free ( www.golang-book.com )


While this book is the oldest of all of these, it is also very good for beginners. Jump over the first few chapters and start on Chapter 4.

Read For Free, Compliments of Ivo Balbaert



Another great book. I’d categorize this one as intermediate. If you have some programming experience, this is a great book with which to begin. Chapter 2 is a bit advanced, as is chapter 7. Consider reading those two chapters last!

A fantastic book, very thorough, but more advanced. Purchase this with one of the other two books above so that you can get different perspectives on the same concept.
